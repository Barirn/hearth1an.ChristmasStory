		<Text>COLEUS: Yes, of course. Imagine if the Ash Twin Project works as intended, why wouldn't we be able to have a remote connection to another planet?</Text>

		<Text>OENO: That makes sense. We can also consider the Timber Hearth mines as a safe place.</Text>

		<Text>COLEUS: Yes. I believe these wires will transmit data to the Ash Twin Project, but I am not sure exactly how it will work. I assume that data transmission will affect the nearest area from 10 to 20 meters.</Text>

		<Text>YARROW: We don't have time for experiments, Coleus. We can only be sure after the Ash Twin Project works properly. Please don't waste your time on it right now.</Text>

		<Text>COLEUS: You're probably right. We should focus more on our main mission. I will continue working on this technology after the Ash Twin Project succeeds.</Text>
