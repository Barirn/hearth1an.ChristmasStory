        "CHERT_START_1": "Hello there! Is this your first launch? Welcome to the Hourglass Twins.",
        "CHERT_START_2": "Yes, it is. What are you doing here exactly?",
        "CHERT_START_3": "Let’s celebrate Christmas! I’m helping travelers get home for the celebration.",
        "CHERT_START_4": "Star charts, you know. This is a great place to spot astronomical events, such as supernovas.",
        "CHERT_START_5": "I’ve actually seen a couple today. It’s very rare.",
        "CHERT_START_6": "I see.",
        "CHERT_START_7": "So, what can I help you with?",
        "CHERT_START_8": "Let’s celebrate Christmas! I’m helping travelers get home for the celebration.",
        "CHERT_START_9": "Nothing. Have a nice day!",
        "CHERT_START_10": "What do you mean? Should I just leave my place and interrupt such important work? Absolutely not.",
        "CHERT_START_11": "Oh, the thing is, I’m in a time loop. Our sun will soon become a supernova. I have seen that happen many times before. I have already explored everything, so you can go back.",
        "CHERT_START_12": "Ha-ha, you’re very funny! Go on, tell me what you know then.",
        "CHERT_START_13": "The Eye of the Universe was found by a nearby solar system species, and their ship is still here.",
        "CHERT_START_14": "Uh-huh...",
        "CHERT_START_15": "The Nomai came from another solar system too, but they were not able to find the Eye because its signal was blocked by the first species.",
        "CHERT_START_16": "Uh-huh.. go on...",
        "CHERT_START_17": "The Nomai made a time-loop machine to find the Eye but died from the Interloper and ghost matter.",
        "CHERT_START_18": "Wow. I was expecting you to say something like \"Sure, I was joking, gotcha! \" but... this...",
        "CHERT_START_20": "It sounds unbelievable... all of it!",
        "CHERT_START_21": "But alright, let’s make a deal: I will go to Timber Hearth if you can prove everything you said.",
        "CHERT_START_22": "Sure! I already know the exact things you would ask: secret information that only you could know, unknown Nomai tech, and any other kind of tech.",
        "CHERT_START_23": "Alright! How do we do this?",
        "CHERT_START_24": "So, if you’re saying you’re in a time loop, you can prove it by telling me something that only I could know.",
        "CHERT_START_25": "You can say: \"Chert, I know that only you know who the Jumbo Marshmallow creator is\".",
        "CHERT_START_26": "Who is it?",
        "CHERT_START_27": "Alright, will that be enough?",
        "CHERT_START_28": "It’s a big secret. Maybe one day you will know, but for now, it’s the only thing I could say.",
        "CHERT_START_29": "Alright, will that be enough?",
        "CHERT_START_30": "No, since you’re saying you are Mr. ’I know everything,’ I’m asking you to bring something new to the table.",
        "CHERT_START_31": "I mean, any unknown Nomai technology, and don’t you dare take anything from the museum!",
        "CHERT_START_32": "What else did you say? The other species’ ship is still here? Cool, bring me something from their tech, and we’re good.",
        "CHERT_START_33": "So, the deal is the secret phrase, some unknown Nomai tech, and something significant from another civilization’s tech. Deal?",
        "CHERT_START_34": "Deal. You better prepare to fly home!",
        "CHERT_START_35": "Chert, I know that only you know who the Jumbo Marshmallow creator is.",
        "CHERT_START_36": "Oh, that was witty. Tell me that in the next loop in case you’re not lying.",
        "CHERT_START_37": "Okay, I’ll do this. Bye.",
        "CHERT_START_38": "Chert, I know that only you know who the Jumbo Marshmallow creator is.",
        "CHERT_START_39": "Good luck, lad!",
        "CHERT_START_40": "Ha-ha.",
        "CHERT_START_41": "So, I’m waiting for all the proofs.",
        "CHERT_START_43": "Here’s the Nomai warp core. They used it to enable the time loop machine.",
        "CHERT_START_44": "Here’s the strangers tech.",
        "CHERT_START_45": "Take a look at this item.",
        "CHERT_START_46": "So, I’ve done everything you asked for. Let’s go home and celebrate?",
        "CHERT_START_47": "I’ll be right back.",
        "CHERT_START_48": "B-o-o-o-ring. Bring something significant!",
        "CHERT_START_49": "Wow. This is really the thing that only I knew. Well, not anymore.",
        "CHERT_START_50": "Sure! I’ll prove everything.",
        "CHERT_START_51": "I... I’m speechless... wait, if it’s enabling the time loop and I can’t see any wires...",
        "CHERT_START_52": "OH NO! BRING IT BACK! NOW!",
        "CHERT_START_53": "Oh, don’t be mad Chert. I’ll figure it out. Calm down!",
        "CHERT_START_54": "Uh... easy to say! Okay, take a deep breath... inhale... exhale...",
        "CHERT_START_55": "Anyway...",
        "CHERT_START_56": "What an interesting tech! It seems like the main concept is based on some sort of light or flame, right?",
        "CHERT_START_57": "Yes. They were all about flames and lights.",
        "CHERT_START_58": "Okay... you won. I don’t feel like I’m doing something important here, so... we can go celebrate Christmas!",
        "CHERT_START_59": "Yay! Let’s go, my ship is nearby.",
        "CHERT_START_60": "Wait a sec. I need to bring my ship closer.",
        "CHERT_START_61": "Oh no, my ship is destroyed. Sorry.",
        "CHERT_START_62": "Oh well, it’s alright. I don’t really need your ship. Mine is functioning. See ya!",
        "CHERT_START_63": "Bon voyage!",
        "CHERT_START_64": "Actually... yeah. That’s what I was thinking too. Nice guess!",
        "CHERT_START_65": "So, are you serious about all this?",
        "CHERT_START_66": "Yes! Let’s get down to business.",

        // Chert tree
        "CHERT_TREE_1": "Hey! I wanted to ask.. how do you cope with all your knowledge?",
        "CHERT_TREE_2": "I’m okay, Chert.",
        "CHERT_TREE_3": "I can imagine...",
        "CHERT_TREE_4": "Oh, is that how those strangers looked?",
        "CHERT_TREE_5": "Yes, exactly.",
        "CHERT_TREE_6": "They were a little creepy and had just two eyes!",
        "CHERT_TREE_7": "Yeah, they were very different and a little creepy.",

        // Ernesto
        "ERNESTO_START_1": "...",
        "ERNESTO_START_2": "Oh, Ernesto, you shine so bright!",
        "ERNESTO_START_3": "We need your lights to finally start!",

        // Esker ship
        "ESKER_SHIP_1": "I don’t remember the last time I was in a spaceship...",
        "ESKER_SHIP_2": "Alright, we’re here! Let’s go celebrate!",
        "ESKER_SHIP_3": "I’ll let you know when we land near the village.",
        "ESKER_SHIP_8": "You even took a chair? Really, Esker?",
        "ESKER_SHIP_9": "Yes, you want me to leave it on the moon?",
        "ESKER_SHIP_10": "No way.",
        "ESKER_SHIP_4": "Let’s go! Merry Christmas!",
        "ESKER_SHIP_5": "So, the flight is over?",
        "ESKER_SHIP_7": "Yes, we’re here! Let’s go celebrate!",
        "ESKER_SHIP_6": "No, but I’ll tell you when we’re about to land.",

        // Esker start
        "ESKER_START_1": "Hey-hey! So we are going home, right?",
        "ESKER_START_2": "Wait, what? How did you know?",
        "ESKER_START_3": "Well... I use the signalscope a lot. I just heard your dialogue with Slate.",
        "ESKER_START_4": "Oh, I see... You scared me sometimes, Esker.",
        "ESKER_START_5": "So... what’s next? Are we going home?",
        "ESKER_START_6": "Yes! I need you to celebrate Christmas. Let’s go!",
        "ESKER_START_7": "Yes, but don’t go anywhere. I need to bring my ship closer.",
        "ESKER_START_8": "I’m sorry, Esker, but it seems like my ship is not working anymore. Sorry.",
        "ESKER_START_9": "Hold on, I need to do something first.",
        "ESKER_START_10": "Alright, I’ll wait for you!",
        "ESKER_START_11": "No celebration then? Sad... We can still sit here with a campfire, you know...",
        "ESKER_START_12": "Gotcha! I’ll wait then.",

        // Esker tree
        "ESKER_TREE_1": "Merry Christmas! Gotta say you’re good pilot.",
        "ESKER_TREE_2": "Thanks! I know I’m pretty good at it.",
        "ESKER_TREE_3": "Do you know anything about Jumbo?",
        "ESKER_TREE_4": "Yes, you’re also very modest.",
        "ESKER_TREE_5": "Who?",
        "ESKER_TREE_6": "Actually... nevermind...",

        // Feldspar note
        "FELDSPAR_NOTE": "Okay, I’m leaving this damned place now. I’m not sure if I’ll succeed without my ship, but at least I’ll try. Feldspar.",

        // Feldspar ship
        "FELDSPAR_SHIP_1": "Nice ship, captain! I’d ask Slate to make a similar one for me. Let me know when we land near the Village, okay?",
        "FELDSPAR_SHIP_2": "We’re already home, welcome back!",
        "FELDSPAR_SHIP_3": "Sure! I’ll let you know.",
        "FELDSPAR_SHIP_4": "Yay! Thanks for the ride. Let’s go celebrate!",
        "FELDSPAR_SHIP_5": "Are we home yet, hatchling?",
        "FELDSPAR_SHIP_6": "Nope, not yet. I’ll let you know when we are.",

        // Feldspar start
        "FELDSPAR_START_1": "Hey bud! I’m glad you found me. Can you help me escape from this cursed place?",
        "FELDSPAR_START_2": "Why did you leave? It was safe there!",
        "FELDSPAR_START_3": "Sure! Let’s go.",
        "FELDSPAR_START_4": "Don’t go anywhere, I’ll bring the ship closer.",
        "FELDSPAR_START_5": "I’m so sorry... but the ship is not functioning... we’re stuck here.",
        "FELDSPAR_START_6": "It was boring there. I saw a little anglerfish and thought it could help me fly away from the bramble, so I followed it and... then I got here...",
        "FELDSPAR_START_7": "Pure luck! I was so scared that I wasn’t able to move. It seems like anglerfish react only to movement. Ha-ha! Another mystery solved!",
        "FELDSPAR_START_8": "Yes! This is pure luck!",
        "FELDSPAR_START_9": "So... can we get out of here?",
        "FELDSPAR_START_10": "Don’t go anywhere? Ha-ha.",
        "FELDSPAR_START_11": "Oh boy... what we gonna do?",

        // Feldspar tree
        "FELDSPAR_TREE_1": "Merry Christmas! I have to admit, I missed the Village.",
        "FELDSPAR_TREE_2": "Glad you’re here, Feldspar.",
        "FELDSPAR_TREE_4": "Yeah, me too. Space adventures can wait sometimes, you know.",
        "FELDSPAR_TREE_5": "Who’s that? That guy looks EXACTLY like you.",
        "FELDSPAR_TREE_6": "Well, this is literally me. From the past.",
        "FELDSPAR_TREE_7": "My nephew.",
        "FELDSPAR_TREE_8": "Ummm, I don’t know, actually.",
        "FELDSPAR_TREE_9": "Ha-ha-ha. Very funny. VERY.",
        "FELDSPAR_TREE_10": "Really? I never knew that. Hm.",
        "FELDSPAR_TREE_11": "Okay, but it’s weird.",

        // Gabbro start
        "GABBRO_START_1": "Hey, it’s you! Congrats on the first launch.",
        "GABBRO_START_2": "I don’t know why, but I keep dying repeatedly. Sounds weird, huh?",
        "GABBRO_START_3": "Yes, we already had this conversation.",
        "GABBRO_START_4": "Yeah, me too. We’re in a time loop. Just you and me.",
        "GABBRO_START_5": "Oh, yes, I remember. So... something went wrong, right?",
        "GABBRO_START_6": "Yes. Let’s try again.",
        "GABBRO_START_7": "Ummm... makes sense. Hornfels didn’t believe me when I told them I keep dying.",
        "GABBRO_START_8": "You seem comfortable here. By the way, we’re celebrating Christmas in the Village. Do you want to join?",
        "GABBRO_START_9": "M-m-m... I don’t know. I feel bored here, to be honest.",
        "GABBRO_START_10": "All this depressing and rainy stuff, you know?",
        "GABBRO_START_11": "But on the other hand... I’m also too bored to fly anywhere or get in your ship.",
        "GABBRO_START_12": "Let’s do what, just explode your ship so we can both die and iniciate new loop! I’ll be in the ship on loop start and fly to Timber Hearth.",
        "GABBRO_START_13": "I never realized you were such a lazy person before.",
        "GABBRO_START_14": "Ha-ha, yep! That’s me.",
        "GABBRO_START_15": "So... I’m wating for ship explosion so I we can die and start new loop.",
        "GABBRO_START_16": "Um. The thing is... my ship is destroyed already.",
        "GABBRO_START_17": "Sure. I’m working on it.",
        "GABBRO_START_18": "No luck then. Try not to screw this up next loop!",
        "GABBRO_START_19": "Got it! I’ll be here.",

        // Gabbro tree
        "GABBRO_TREE_1": "Hey! That was a really huge explosion! Are you alright?",
        "GABBRO_TREE_2": "I’m alright, Gabbro.",
        "GABBRO_TREE_3": "Meh. I could have just brought you here without dying.",
        "GABBRO_TREE_4": "Good! I already miss my hammock.",
        "GABBRO_TREE_5": "Yes?",
        "GABBRO_TREE_6": "Don’t you have a strange feeling about this place?",
        "GABBRO_TREE_7": "Nothing.",
        "GABBRO_TREE_8": "You feel that too? Seems like the time loop is shifting for everyone near the tree... Maybe it’s because of Nomai wires under it.",
        "GABBRO_TREE_9": "That’s just my guess.",
        "GABBRO_TREE_10": "See ya!",
        "GABBRO_TREE_11": "Don’t be snobby, it was fun at least!",

        // Hal
        "HAL_START_1": "Hey! Are you feeling nervous about the first launch? I know that feeling! I’m nervous about it too!",
        "HAL_START_2": "You’ll be the first astronaut with a Nomai translator. I’m so excited about this!",
        "HAL_START_3": "Hal, can you write a custom Nomai text for me?",
        "HAL_START_4": "I think I’m good, Hal. I gotta go.",
        "HAL_START_5": "What are you doing with this rock?",
        "HAL_START_6": "That’s what I’m talking about! Good luck in space!",
        "HAL_START_7": "I’m just practicing writing in Nomai. Since I made a Nomai translator, I should be able to write in their language.",
        "HAL_START_8": "I actually don’t know what their language is called. Whatever... no one could read it anyway.",
        "HAL_START_9": "True. Good luck with it.",
        "HAL_START_10": "Sure! As you can see, I’m already practicing. So, is this for translator testing, right?",
        "HAL_START_11": "Of course. Please write: \"Dear Solanum, I’m inviting you to the Village to celebrate Christmas!\"",
        "HAL_START_12": "That’s a very specific text. Are we celebrating something? Ah, actually nevermind.",
        "HAL_START_13": "Let’s see if I can do this...",
        "HAL_START_14": "Good luck in space, friend!",
        "HAL_START_15": "Thanks! I gotta go.",

        // Hal final
        "HAL_FINAL_1": "Whoa, I see now what you meant about celebrating!",
        "HAL_FINAL_2": "Sure, and see what I did with your rock! I invited a living Nomai!",
        "HAL_FINAL_3": "Yep. It’s very cool.",
        "HAL_FINAL_4": "UNBELIEVABLE! Wait, stop, maybe it’s an illusion?",
        "HAL_FINAL_5": "Or am I just dreaming? It’s too good to be true!",
        "HAL_FINAL_6": "What do we do next? Maybe ask Hornfels?",
        "HAL_FINAL_7": "S-s-sorry. I’m literally speechless.",

        // Hal rock
        "HAL_ROCK_1": "Alright, here you go.",
        "HAL_ROCK_2": "I know the writing is not perfect, but who knows... maybe I am the last person alive who knows this language.",
        "HAL_ROCK_3": "Thank you! Bye!",
        "HAL_ROCK_4": "So, what are you going to do with that rock? I’m very curious.",
        "HAL_ROCK_5": "Hmm, maybe I’ll show it to the real Nomai.",
        "HAL_ROCK_6": "Ha-ha-ha. Ha-haha-ha.",
        "HAL_ROCK_7": "Very funny.",
        "HAL_ROCK_8": "Sorry, I can’t talk with you right now.",
        "HAL_ROCK_9": "Your joke was too good.",

        "HORNFELS_FINAL_4": "So what’s next?",
        "HORNFELS_FINAL_5": "Yes, I don’t remember the last time we had such a gathering. All together.",
        "HORNFELS_FINAL_6": "So what’s next?",
        "HORNFELS_FINAL_7": "The lights are very nice, but I think we are missing the main detail on the top.",
        "HORNFELS_FINAL_8": "We need something bright and shiny to put on the top of the tree.",
        "HORNFELS_FINAL_9": "Can you bring something like that from the observatory?",
        "HORNFELS_FINAL_10": "Sure, I’m on my way.",
        "HORNFELS_FINAL_11": "We need something bright and shiny to put in on the top of the tree. Bring something like that from observatory.",
        "HORNFELS_FINAL_13": "Thanks.",
        "HORNFELS_FINAL_14": "I’ll be here.",

        "PORPHY_TREE_7": "But honestly such temperature is better for wine in barrels.",
        "PORPHY_TREE_8": "Okay, got it. I gotta go.",
        "PORPHY_TREE_9": "Glad to hear it! You know how importaint our space program is, we believe in you, Hornfels especially.",
        "PORPHY_TREE_10": "Sure! What is this barrel in the center by the way?",
        "PORPHY_TREE_11": "Oh, yes, it’s the biggest one from my colletction. You like it?",
        "PORPHY_TREE_12": "Seems like this geyser is not functiouning and we had to block it’s hole for safety. We’ll see if wine in it will have different taste.",
        "PORPHY_TREE_13": "Anyway, I feel like with this tree and flares it was totally worth it.",

        "SLATE_START_5": "Is it winter here or something?",
        "SLATE_START_6": "Alright, you’ll need to get the launch codes from Hornfels at the observatory, but hear me out: as you can see, winter has come to our Village, which means we’re going to celebrate Christmas!",
        "SLATE_START_7": "We had to remove some inactive geysers to make space for a glorious tree and our celebration plans. We even found some strange Nomai wires there.",
        "SLATE_START_8": "Celebration plan?",
        "SLATE_START_9": "But not all the geysers were inactive, were they?",
        "SLATE_START_10": "Yes, some of them are still active. It’s snowing a bit. Marl chopped down this beautiful tree, and I made the lights, but...",
        "SLATE_START_11": "...sometimes the blue ones shine too bright, like they’re overloaded with energy. Weird.",
        "SLATE_START_12": "Anyway, it seems like everyone is happy with winter. Go ask them before liftoff.",
        "SLATE_START_13": "Sure. Can’t wait to begin my space adventure!",
        "SLATE_START_14": "Okay, thanks for reminding.",
        "SLATE_START_15": "Umm, I’m not sure. You can ask Porphy about this.",
        "SLATE_START_16": "So, what’s the celebration plan?",
        "SLATE_START_17": "Regarding the celebration, we need to bring all the travellers back home. I asked Esker a few times to help, but he keeps forgetting, as if we never had this conversation!",
        "SLATE_START_18": "Since it’s your launch day and there are no other pilots here, it will be your mission to bring them all back. You can start with Esker, actually.",
        "SLATE_START_19": "We can surprise Hornfels and Hal, so please don’t tell them anything. Let me know when everyone is here so we can start the celebration.",
        "SLATE_START_20": "Great plan! I can’t wait to bring them all back.",
        "SLATE_START_21": "You need to find the travellers, tell them about the celebration, and bring them here.",
        "SLATE_START_22": "Hornfels should be kept in the dark about this until everyone is here.",
        "SLATE_START_24": "Okay, thanks for reminding.",
        "SLATE_START_25": "Yes! It’s too quiet here. We need their music, or Christmas magic will never happen. So...",
        "SLATE_START_26": "Do you have any questions left?",
        "SLATE_START_27": "Is it a little scout?",
        "SLATE_START_28": "Nope, everyhing is clear to me.",
        "SLATE_START_31": "Good. I’ll be here if you need me.",
        "SLATE_START_32": "Sure. I’ll be here.",
        "SLATE_START_33": "Yeah, I made an upgrade for your scout. Now it has a little Nomai gravity crystal on it! You can launch it onto the wall and literally stay horizontally. It’s neat, you should give it a try.",
        "SLATE_START_34": "Sounds good!",
        "SLATE_START_35": "Just be careful using it in places where you’re not supposed to stand. That makes it more dangerous to fall, so keep that in mind.",
        "SLATE_START_36": "Good point. Thanks.",
        "SLATE_START_37": "Great job, hatchling! I’m glad all our friends are here and the music is playing.",
        "SLATE_START_38": "Are we ready to tell Hornfels and Hal? Do you want to invite anyone else?",
        "SLATE_START_39": "Actually, I need more time to invite someone else.",
        "SLATE_START_40": "Yes, let’s get started.",
        "SLATE_START_41": "Just kidding! All the travelers are here already. Who else would you like to invite?",
        "SLATE_START_42": "Actually, nevermind. Just tell me whenever we ready to start.",
        "SLATE_START_43": "Yes, I’ll let you know.",
        "SLATE_START_44": "Let’s start.",
        "SLATE_START_45": "So, are you we ready to tell Hornfels and Hal? Are you done with other \"invites?\"",
        "SLATE_START_46": "No, not yet. I’ll let you know.",
        "SLATE_START_47": "Yes, let’s start.",
        "SLATE_START_48": "Okay, I’ll go get Hornfels and Hal.",
