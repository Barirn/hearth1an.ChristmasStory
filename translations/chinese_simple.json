		"CHERT_START_1": "欢迎！你是第一次发射吗？欢迎来到沙漏双星。",
		"CHERT_START_2": "是的，你在这里干什么？",
		"CHERT_START_3": "让我们庆祝圣诞节吧！我正在把各处的飞行员们叫回去参加庆典。",
		"CHERT_START_4": "绘制星图，明白吗。这里是观测天文事件的绝佳地点，比如超新星爆发。",
		"CHERT_START_5": "我今天已经看到好几颗超新星了。这很奇怪，毕竟这本该是很罕见的。",
		"CHERT_START_6": "我知道。",
		"CHERT_START_7": "所以，有什么我能帮上忙的吗？",
		"CHERT_START_8": "让我们庆祝圣诞节吧！我正在把各处的飞行员们叫回去参加庆典。",
		"CHERT_START_9": "没事，祝你今天开心。",
		"CHERT_START_10": "什么意思？你想打断这么重要的工作然后让我离开这里？<![CDATA[<i>]]>绝不。<![CDATA[</i>]]>",

		"CHERT_START_10.1": "顺带一提，我朋友加布罗回去了吗？",
		"CHERT_START_10.2": "没。还没有。",
		"CHERT_START_10.3": "是的！你应该加入我们。",
		"CHERT_START_10.4": "如果加布罗不在，那我也不回去。你先去问问别人吧，然后我会考虑一下的。",
		"CHERT_START_10.5": "好吧。继续，告诉我我为什么应该放下所有手头工作然后和你回去。",
		"CHERT_START_10.6": "所以，加布罗也回去了？",

		"CHERT_START_11": "哦，事实上，我们处于一个时间循环中，然后太阳马上就要爆炸了。我已经看到好几次了。而且，我已经把所有地方都探索过了，所以你可以停工回家了。",
		"CHERT_START_12": "哈哈，你真逗！继续，告诉我你知道的所有事。",
		"CHERT_START_13": "宇宙之眼最初被邻近星系的一个物种发现了，他们来到了这里，时至今日他们的隐形飞船仍在这里",
		"CHERT_START_14": "哦...呃...",
		"CHERT_START_15": "挪麦人也来自其他星系，但他们无法找到眼，因为眼的信号被前一个种族屏蔽了。",
		"CHERT_START_16": "哦...呃...继续",
		"CHERT_START_17": "挪麦人制造了一台时间循环机器通过反复试错来寻找眼。但他们死于闯入者中爆发的席卷整个哈斯星系的幽灵物质。",
		"CHERT_START_18": "哇哦。我以为你会再说一些诸如 <![CDATA[<i>]]>\"哈哈，我在开玩笑。你被骗了！\"<![CDATA[</i>]]>的话。但这...",
		"CHERT_START_20": "这听起来太不可思议了... <![CDATA[<i>]]>不管哪一句！<![CDATA[</i>]]>",
		"CHERT_START_21": "不过，好吧...让我们做个交易：如果你能证明你说的所有事。我就回木炉星。",
		"CHERT_START_22": "当然！我已经知道你要说的是哪些事了：只有你知道的秘密信息，没见过的完好挪麦科技造物，以及完全不同的新文明的科技。",
		"CHERT_START_23": "当然！我们怎么做？",
		"CHERT_START_24": "所以...既然你说你处在时间循环中，你可以通过跟我说些 <![CDATA[<i>]]>只有我能知道<![CDATA[</i>]]>的事来证明。",
		"CHERT_START_25": "你可以说： <![CDATA[<i>]]>\"切特, 我知道‘只有你知道谁发明了Jumbo牌棉花糖’\".<![CDATA[</i>]]>",
		"CHERT_START_26": "是谁？",
		"CHERT_START_27": "好吧，这就够了？",
		"CHERT_START_28": "这是个秘密。也许有一天你会知道的，但现在，我只能告诉你我知道。",
		"CHERT_START_29": "好吧，这就够了？",
		"CHERT_START_30": "不，当你说你是\"无所不知\"先生时，我会要求你带来一些新发现。",
		"CHERT_START_31": "我是说,任何我没见过的完好挪麦科技造物，所以不能是从博物馆拿的。",
		"CHERT_START_32": "你还说了什么来着？另外一个种族的飞船还在这星系里？酷，带给我一件他们的科技产物，这就够了。",
		"CHERT_START_33": "所以，交易内容是一句暗号，没见过的完好挪麦科技造物和一个显然来自其他文明的造物。成交？",
		"CHERT_START_34": "成交！你最好提前做好回家的准备。",
		"CHERT_START_35": "切特, 我知道‘只有你知道谁发明了Jumbo牌棉花糖’",
		"CHERT_START_36": "哦，真有趣。如果你没撒谎的话，下个循环就再讲给我听吧。",
		"CHERT_START_37": "好的。我会的，拜拜。",
		"CHERT_START_38": "切特, 我知道‘只有你知道谁发明了Jumbo牌棉花糖’",
		"CHERT_START_39": "一路顺风。",
		"CHERT_START_40": "哈哈。",
		"CHERT_START_41": "所以，我在等所有的证据。",
		"CHERT_START_43": "这是一枚高级跃迁核心。他们用这个驱动时间循环装置。",
		"CHERT_START_44": "这是外星站居民的科技。",
		"CHERT_START_45": "看看这个。",
		"CHERT_START_46": "所以，我完成了所有你要求的事。你现在能跟我回家了吗？",
		"CHERT_START_47": "我马上回去。",
		"CHERT_START_48": "无——聊——。带点更有趣的东西来。",
		"CHERT_START_49": "哇哦。这确实是只有我知道的事。好吧，至少现在不再是了。",
		"CHERT_START_50": "当然！我会证明所有事。",
		"CHERT_START_51": "我...我无话可说...等等，如果这个是用来驱动时间循环的东西的话，而且上面什么都没接...",
		"CHERT_START_52": "不！！!把它放回去！现在！！！",
		"CHERT_START_53": "哦，别激动切特。我会修好它的。",
		"CHERT_START_54": "呃...说起来轻松。好吧，做个深呼吸... 吸气... 呼气...",
		// "CHERT_START_55": "反正...",
		"CHERT_START_56": "真是个有趣的文物！看起来，他们科技的核心概念是基于某种光线和火焰，我说的对吗？做得好！",
		"CHERT_START_57": "是的，他们的科技总是和光与焰相关。",

		"CHERT_START_57.1": "有一说一，这真是令人兴奋... 我没想到竟然...",

		"CHERT_START_58": "好吧...你赢了。我的世界观<![CDATA[<i>]]>碎了一地！<![CDATA[</i>]]>我觉得我现在做的事可能微不足道。好吧，让我们回去欢庆圣诞吧。",
		"CHERT_START_59": "耶！走吧，我的飞船就在附近。",
		"CHERT_START_60": "等等，我得把我的飞船停的近一些。",
		"CHERT_START_61": "哦不，我的飞船已经报废了，抱歉。",
		"CHERT_START_62": "好吧，无所谓的。我不需要你的飞船，我的飞船还能发动。回见！",
		"CHERT_START_63": "旅行愉快！",
		"CHERT_START_64": "事实上...是的。我也是这么想的。测得很准！",
		"CHERT_START_65": "所以，<![CDATA[<i>]]>你是认真的？<![CDATA[</i>]]>",
		"CHERT_START_66": "是的！ 我们开始谈正事吧。",

		"CHERT_START_67": "你能提醒我一下剩下什么吗？",
		"CHERT_START_68": "当然，让我看看，还差...",
		"CHERT_START_69": "你告诉了我暗号，现在你需要带一些未知的完好挪麦科技和你说的邻近星系的种族的技术。",
		"CHERT_START_70": "感谢提醒，切特。我马上回来。",
		"CHERT_START_71": "你告诉了我暗号并给我展示了挪麦的高级跃迁核心。现在只差你说的邻近星系的种族的技术。",
		"CHERT_START_72": "你告诉了我暗号并给我展示了邻近星系的种族的文物。现在只等你带给我一些挪麦的未知的科技。",


		// Chert tree
		"CHERT_TREE_1": "嘿！ 我想问..你如何处理你所有的知识？",
		"CHERT_TREE_2": "我只是接受。我很好，切特。",
		"CHERT_TREE_3": "我能想象...",
		"CHERT_TREE_4": "哦，这是那些外星站居民的样子吗？",
		"CHERT_TREE_5": "是的，没错",
		"CHERT_TREE_6": "他们有点吓人，而且只有两个眼睛。",
		"CHERT_TREE_7": "是的，他们看起来和我们很不一样，而且有点吓人。",

		// Ernesto
		"ERNESTO_START_1": "...",
		"ERNESTO_START_2": "哦，厄内斯托，你好耀眼！",
		"ERNESTO_START_3": "我们需要你的光才能开始！",

		// Esker ship
		"ESKER_SHIP_1": "我已经记不清上次我登上飞船时的事了...",
		"ESKER_SHIP_2": "好了，我们到了。让我们去参加庆典吧！",
		"ESKER_SHIP_3": "当我们在村子里降落后我会通知你的。",
		"ESKER_SHIP_8": "埃斯科，你甚至把你的椅子带上了？",
		"ESKER_SHIP_9": "是的! 等等,难道你想让我把它留在废岩星上吗？",
		"ESKER_SHIP_10": "绝无可能。",
		"ESKER_SHIP_4": "我们走吧！圣诞快乐！",
		"ESKER_SHIP_5": "所以，飞行结束了？",
		"ESKER_SHIP_7": "是的，我们到了！让我们去参加庆典吧！",
		"ESKER_SHIP_6": "还没有，不过着陆后我会告诉你的。",

		// Esker start
		"ESKER_START_1": "嗨嗨嗨！所以你是来接我回家的？",
		"ESKER_START_2": "啊？你怎么知道？",
		// I change this line since Esker isn't in the loop yet so maybe Slate didn't say it to the player this loop
		"ESKER_START_3": "额...我在这还挺孤单的,所以我用信号镜收听了不少从村子来的信号...我已经听斯雷特说过了",
		"ESKER_START_4": "哦，原来如此...埃斯科，你吓我一跳。",
		"ESKER_START_5": "所以...接下来呢？我们要回家了？",
		"ESKER_START_6": "是的！我需要你和我们一起庆祝圣诞节。走吧！",
		"ESKER_START_7": "是的，不过你别乱走。我要把我的飞船开过来。",
		"ESKER_START_8": "抱歉，埃斯科，我的飞船已经报废了。",
		"ESKER_START_9": "稍等一下，我还有点事要做。",
		"ESKER_START_10": "好吧，我会等你的！",
		"ESKER_START_11": "那就不庆祝了？ 可惜了...不过我们仍然可以在我的篝火旁休息，你知道的...",
		"ESKER_START_12": "明白了！那我就等着了。",

		// Esker tree
		"ESKER_TREE_1": "圣诞快乐！不得不说你是个优秀的驾驶员。",
		"ESKER_TREE_2": "谢谢。不过我很清楚自己飞得不错。",
		"ESKER_TREE_3": "你对Jumbo棉花糖了解吗？",
		"ESKER_TREE_4": "是的，你太客气了。",
		"ESKER_TREE_5": "谁？啥？",
		"ESKER_TREE_6": "没事...当我没说...",

		// Feldspar note
		"FELDSPAR_NOTE": "好吧，我现在要离开这个鬼地方。 我不确定没有船我是否会成功，但至少我会尝试。我的口琴复读机应该有助于找到这个音符。 \n <![CDATA[<i>]]>- 费尔德斯巴<![CDATA[</i>]]>",

		// Feldspar ship
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_1.1": "哇！ 我想这就是我跟着的安康鱼！不知道它是否危险，因为它太小了。",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_1": "顺带一提，不错的船！ 我会请斯雷特为我制作一个这样的新款。 当我们降落在村庄附近时请告诉我，好吗？",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_2": "我们已经到家了，欢迎回来！",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_3": "当然！ 我会告诉你。",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_4": "耶！感谢你带我一程，让我们回去欢庆圣诞吧！",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_5": "我们到家了吗，新人？",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_6": "没，还没。 等我们到达时，我会通知你的。",

		// Feldspar start
		"FELDSPAR_START_1": "嘿伙计！ 我很高兴你找到了我。 你能帮我逃离这个被诅咒的地方吗？",
		"FELDSPAR_START_2": "你为什么不留在安康鱼的骨架那里？那里很安全的。",
		"FELDSPAR_START_3": "好！我们走吧。",
		"FELDSPAR_START_4": "哪里都别去，我会把我的船开的近一些。",
		"FELDSPAR_START_5": "很抱歉...但是我的飞船无法运转...我们被困在这里了。",
		"FELDSPAR_START_6": "那里很安全，但最终我准备进行更多冒险。 我看到一条小安康鱼，我认为它可以带我飞离黑棘星，所以我跟着它，然后……好吧……然后我就到了这里……",
		"FELDSPAR_START_7": "纯属运气！ 我吓得一动也不敢动。但似乎因为我一动不动以致于安静得连安康鱼都看不到我。哈哈！又一个谜团解开了！",
		"FELDSPAR_START_8": "哇，是的，这真的是纯粹的运气！",
		"FELDSPAR_START_9": "那么...你能带我们离开这里吗？",
		"FELDSPAR_START_10": "哪儿也不去？ 哈哈。",
		"FELDSPAR_START_11": "哦，天那...那我们现在要做什么？",

		// Feldspar tree
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_1": "圣诞节快乐！ 我不得不承认，我真的很想念这个村子。",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_2": "很高兴你在这里，费尔德斯巴。",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_4": "我也是。想成为最伟大的太空冒险家的话需要等等了，你知道吗？",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_5": "那是谁？ 那家伙看起来和你一模一样。",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_6": "嗯，他们确实是我。 从过去而来。",
		// Changed from nephew to be gender neutral since Hearthians have no gender
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_7": "我的表亲。",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_8": "嗯，实际上我不知道。",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_9": "哈哈哈。真有趣，真的。",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_10": "真的？我才知道。",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_11": "好吧，真是奇怪。",

		// Gabbro start
		"GABBRO_START_1": "嘿，是你！ 恭喜你首次发射。",
		"GABBRO_START_2": "不知道为什么，我总是反复地死去。 听起来很奇怪，是吧？",
		"GABBRO_START_3": "是的，我们已经进行过这样的谈话。",
		"GABBRO_START_4": "我也是。 我们处于时间循环中。 只有你和我自己知道。",
		"GABBRO_START_5": "哦，是的，我记得。 那么……出了什么问题，对吧？",
		"GABBRO_START_6": "是的。 让我们再试一次。",
		"GABBRO_START_7": "嗯……有道理。 当我告诉霍恩菲斯我一直在死去时，他们根本不信。",
		"GABBRO_START_8": "你在这里看起来挺悠闲。 顺便说一句，我们正在村里庆祝圣诞节。 你想要加入吗？",
		"GABBRO_START_9": "嗯……我不知道。 老实说，我在这里感到无聊。",
		"GABBRO_START_10": "这阴郁的雨...你知道吗？",
		"GABBRO_START_11": "但另一方面……我也太无聊了，不想飞到任何地方或登上你的船。",
		"GABBRO_START_12": "这里有一个主意，炸掉你的船，这样我们就都死了，然后开始一个新的循环！ 新循环带来的的兴奋会给我干劲，然后我会回到我的船上，然后我可以飞回木炉星的家。",
		"GABBRO_START_13": "让船发生大爆炸？！ 你疯了？！ 好吧，我们开始吧！",
		"GABBRO_START_14": "哈哈，是啊！ <![CDATA[<i>*吹口哨*</i>]]>",
		"GABBRO_START_14.1": "顺便问一下，还记得天文台的新展览吗？ 有<![CDATA[<i>]]>一个秘密<![CDATA[</i>]]>与之关联。 但我只会在木炉星跟你聊这件事。",
		"GABBRO_START_15": "所以……我就等着飞船爆炸！ 快点杀了我，这样我们就可以开始一个新的循环...并告诉你<![CDATA[<i>]]>秘密！<![CDATA[</i>]]>。我还能教你如何冥想！",
		"GABBRO_START_16": "嗯。 问题是...我的船已经被毁了。",
		"GABBRO_START_17": "当然。我正在努力。",
		"GABBRO_START_18": "真倒霉。尽量不要在下一个循环中搞砸！",
		"GABBRO_START_19": "知道了！ 我马上到位",


		// Gabbro tree
		"GABBRO_TREE_1": "嘿！ 那真是一次巨大的爆炸！ 你还好吗？",
		"GABBRO_TREE_2": "我没事，加布罗。 时间循环，还记得吗？",
		"GABBRO_TREE_3": "嗯。 我本可以把你带到这里而不用死一趟。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_4": "好的！ 我已经开始想念我的吊床了。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_5": "是吗？",
		"GABBRO_TREE_6": "难道你对这个地方没有一种奇怪的感觉吗？",
		"GABBRO_TREE_7": "没。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_8": "你也有这样的感觉吗？ 似乎时间循环在因为树附近的每个人而发生变化……也许是因为我们用来点亮它的是挪麦的电线。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_9": "至少，这只是我的猜测。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_10": "回见！",
		"GABBRO_TREE_11": "别不识趣，这至少很有趣！",
		"GABBRO_TREE_12": "讲一讲你说的那个 <![CDATA[<i>]]>秘密？<![CDATA[</i>]]>",
		"GABBRO_TREE_13": "是的！ 差点忘了这件事。 深空卫星曾经探测到一个奇怪的物体覆盖了我们的太阳，但只是从特点角度。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_14": "有一天，我瞒着所有人飞到那里，发现了一个奇怪的外星站！它不像是挪麦科技的产物。老实说，这让我感到害怕，所以我直接离开了，没有告诉任何人。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_15": "但是，嘿，在时间循环中很难害怕任何事情，对吧？ 如果你愿意的话，我可以把它的坐标发给你，如果你有一天想参观一下的话。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_16": "好，请分享给我！",
		"GABBRO_TREE_17": "不，谢谢，我很好。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_18": "好吧，我明白！ 有些事情最好隐藏起来。 如果你改变主意，请告诉我。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_19": "好的，我正在将其上传到你的飞船日志中。 当你回到你的船上时它应该就在那里。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_20": "我改变主意了，你能给我外星站的坐标吗？",

		"GABBRO_MEDITATION_1": "你能教我如何冥想吗？",
		"GABBRO_MEDITATION_2": "当然！ 听我说...",

		"HAL_START_3": "Hal, can you write down a message in Nomai for me?",
		"HAL_START_4": "I think I'm good, Hal. I gotta go.",
		"HAL_START_5": "What are you doing with this rock?",
		"HAL_START_6": "That's what I'm talking about! Good luck in space!",

		"HAL_START_10": "Sure! As you can see, I'm already practicing. So, this must be for testing the translator, right?",
		"HAL_START_11": "Of course. Please write: <![CDATA[<i>]]>\"Dear Solanum, I'm inviting you to the Village to celebrate Christmas!\"<![CDATA[</i>]]>",

		"HAL_FINAL_4": "UNBELIEVABLE! Wait, stop, maybe it's an illusion? Some sort of hologram technology?",
		"HAL_FINAL_5": "Or am I just dreaming? It's too good to be true!",

		"HAL_ROCK_4": "So, what are you going to do with that rock? I'm very curious.",
